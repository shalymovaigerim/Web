    <h3>Formal Form of The Pronoun You</h3>
    <p class="mb-5" > Many wonder, why English doesn't have a formal form of the pronoun You. In the past people used 2 types of You: Thou and You. Thou being the informal and You a formal form. With time like many things people stopped using Thou and just replaced it with You. </p>
